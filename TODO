	* Look at gorilla for inspiration

* Text Rendering

* Particle Effects
	* Emitters

	* Instances should hold state of the animation

* Optimizations
	* Culling
		* Node/Entity/Light bounding sphere vs camera bounding sphere culling
		* Node/Entity/Light bounding box vs camera frustum culling
	* Batching
	* Instancing
	* Level of detail
	* Impostors

* Mesh format
	* Morph animations
	* Level of detail

* Use compressed DDS files since they are faster to load and increase performance
* Load DDS files manually to hand them to the GPU directly without uncompressing
