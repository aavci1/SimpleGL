* Rendering
  * Ambient
  * Emissive
  * Bump/Normal/Displacement/Parallax mapping
  * Specular mapping
  * Shadow mapping
    * Adaptive shadow map atlas
    * Soft shadows (GPU Gems 3)
    * Paralel split shadow
  * Blending mutliple textures
  * Transparent objects

* Post-production effects
  * SSAO
  * Depth of field
  * Motion blur
  * Bloom
  * HDR
  * Cel shading
  * Glow

* Realtime shader generation
  * Create shaders on the fly based on material properties
  * Ability to give custom shaders

* GUI / Overlays
  * Look at gorilla for inspiration

* Text Rendering

* Particle Effects
  * Emitters

* Model -> Instance
  * Skeleton -> SkeletonState (bone transforms etc)
  * Animations -> AnimationStates (start/stop, time)
  * Meshes -> MeshStates (material etc)

* Optimizations
  * Camera Frustum Culling
  * Accelerated scene structure (octrees?)
  * Sort Elements front-to-back
  * Uniform Buffers (for bones etc)
  * Instancing
  * Level of detail
  * Impostors

* Mesh format
  * Morph animations
  * Level of detail

* Use compressed DDS files since they are faster to load and increase performance
* Load DDS files manually to hand them to the GPU directly without uncompressing
