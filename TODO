* Rendering
	* Ambient
	* Emissive
	* Bump/Normal/Displacement/Parallax mapping
	* Specular mapping
	* Hardware skinning
	* Shadow mapping
		* Adaptive shadow map atlas
		* Soft shadows (GPU Gems 3)
		* Paralel split shadow
	* Blending mutliple textures
	* Transparent objects

* Post-production effects
	* SSAO
	* Depth of field
	* Motion blur
	* Bloom
	* HDR
	* Cel shading

* GUI / Overlays
	* Look at gorilla for inspiration

* Text Rendering

* Particle Effects
	* Emitters
* Scene Graph
	* Create a common base for object attachable to scene nodes
	* Inherit transformations from parent
	* Entity/Instance class to hold per instance properties of a mesh (material etc)

* Optimizations
	* Culling
		* Node/Entity/Light bounding sphere vs camera bounding sphere culling
		* Node/Entity/Light bounding box vs camera frustum culling
	* Batching
	* Instancing
	* Level of detail
	* Impostors

* Mesh format
	* Proprietary format directly sendable to the GPU
	* Use collada as an intermediate format
	* Position/Normal/Tangent/Bitangent/Joint Weights/TexCoords
	* Skeleton information
	* Animation key frame information
	* Level of detail

* Use compressed DDS files since they are faster to load and increase performance
* Load DDS files manually to hand them to the GPU directly without uncompressing
