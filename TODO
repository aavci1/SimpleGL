* Entity/Instance class to hold per insance properties of a mesh
	* Material properties
* Create a common class for entity, light and camera
* SceneNode transformations
	* Inherit position, orientation, scale from parent
* Culling
	* Lights
		* Bounding sphere vs camera bounding sphere, bounding box vs camera frustum
	* Meshes
		* Bounding sphere vs camera bounding sphere, bounding box vs camera frustum
* Animations
	* Load animations
	* Play animations through a timeline
	* Hardware skinning
* Mesh format
	* Create a proprietary mesh format or convert collada to binary (using ebml / exi etc)
	* Creating a simple format may be faster because we can just read the vertex data and send to the GPU
* Tangents / Bitangents
* Extra materials
	* Hardware skinning
	* Bump/normal/displacement mapping
	* Specular maps
	* Blended maps (terrain etc)
* Ambient / emissive pass
